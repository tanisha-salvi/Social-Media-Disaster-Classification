# Social-Media-Disaster-Classification

Social media platforms are critical sources of real-time information during disasters, offering valuable insights into casualties, infrastructure damage, and missing persons. While previous research has predominantly focused on textual data, this study leverages both text and image content to provide a more comprehensive understanding of disaster events. We employ a multimodal deep learning architecture based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn a shared representation by combining the two modalities (text and images). We have used EfficientNetB3 for Image Modality and BERT for Text Modality. The results underscore the effectiveness of fusing text and image data for more accurate disaster analysis, which can significantly enhance situational awareness and decision-making during crisis response efforts.
